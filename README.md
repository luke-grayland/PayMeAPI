# PayMe API (Spring Boot & MongoDB)

This project is part of my effort to familiarise myself with modern Java practices by getting hands on with Spring Boot. I'm mapping concepts I already know from C#‚Äîlike DI, async programming, and clean architecture‚Äîto their Java equivalents.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Functionality

- **RESTful API Endpoints:**
    
    Basic `GET` and `POST` examples implemented using Spring MVC `@RestController`.
    
- **Dependency Injection:**
    
    Using Spring's `@Autowired` annotation and constructor injection for managing dependencies.
    
- **Data Persistence with MongoDB:**
    
    Integrated MongoDB using Spring Data, with a dedicated repository and service layer.
    
- **Logging:**
    
    Implemented structured logging using SLF4J with Logback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Planned Features

I plan to continue evolving this project with the following:

- **Mutual TLS (mTLS):**
    
    Load and attach X.509 certificates to outbound HTTP requests using Java's `SSLContext` and `HttpClient`.
    
- **Use of Generics:**
    
    Explore Java generics in differentvarious contexts, focusing on writing type-safe, flexible components and utilities.
    
- **LINQ Equivalent:**
    
    Utilise Java Streams API for data filtering, mapping, and transformation.
    
- **Async/Await Equivalent:**
    
    Implement asynchronous operations using `CompletableFuture` for non-blocking APIs.
    
- **Caching:**
    
    Integrate in-memory caching using `Caffeine` or `Spring Cache` abstraction.
    
- **Unit Testing:**
    
    Write unit tests using `JUnit 5` (Jupiter) for core testing & `Mockito` for mocking dependencies.

- **Cloud Deployment (Expanding Azure knowledge to AWS):**
    
    Package and deploy the application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk (hosting), AWS Secrets Manager (config secrets), and AWS Cloud Watch (logging).
